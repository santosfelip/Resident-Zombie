# The Resident Zombie
 - This project is the resolution of the following tests:
   - Frontend: https://gist.github.com/akitaonrails/694fc9e85735c400d7e0dc8e79576288
   - Backend: https://gist.github.com/akitaonrails/711b5553533d1a14364907bbcdbee677
 - In order to solve the proposed test, I developed a system using JS with React on the frontend and Node on the Backend;
 - To simulate the 'apocalyptic' scenario, the system uses a designer with the theme 'Dark', with simple functions, which can be identified with icons. 
Hope you like it :)

## Setup: Frontend
 - Frontend: The system was developed in JavaScript using the Reactjs library, to start the application run the following command in the project 'frontend' folder:
 ```bash
  yarn install
  yarn run start
 ```
 The application will start at port 3000;
 If you do not use ```` yarn````, run the following npm command in the project 'frontend' folder:
 ```bash
  npm i
  npm run start
 ```
 ## Setup: Backend
 - BD: The system uses the No-SQL Mongodb database, it needs to be installed on your machine to run the application, if you don't have it, click on the link:
 [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
 - Backend: The system was developed in Nodejs, to start the application run the following command in the 'frontend' folder of the project:
 ```bash
  yarn install
  yarn run dev
 ```
The application will start on port 3003;
 If you do not use ```` yarn````, run the following npm command in the project's 'frontend' folder:
 ```bash
  npm i
  npm run dev
 ```
